// a step by step approach to solce a particular problem
// should be understood by a non technical person
// Algorithm analysis - helps in identification of optimal algorithm
// understand the trade off of time and space requirement.

// worst case is computed always for the analysis as it dictates maximum resource requirements 
// Time complexity = determines the total number of unit operations to be undertaken to solve a particular problem
// unit operation- an independent operation that cannot be broken down in to simpler operation
// it is independent of architecture
// computed on the basis of the algorithm itself
